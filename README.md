# Drag and Drop using jQuery

## 📌 Overview

The **Drag and Drop using jQuery** project is an interactive web feature that allows users to move elements freely within a designated area. It enhances user experience by providing a smooth and intuitive drag-and-drop mechanism.

## 🛠 Features

- Drag elements and drop them within a target container.
- Smooth animations and responsive design.
- Supports multiple draggable elements.
- Easy to integrate into any project.
- Lightweight and efficient.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML** - Structure of the draggable elements.
- **CSS** - Styling and animations.
- **jQuery UI** - Handles drag-and-drop functionality.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
drag-and-drop-jquery/
│-- index.html   # Main HTML file
│-- style.css    # CSS file for styling
│-- script.js    # jQuery functionality
```
